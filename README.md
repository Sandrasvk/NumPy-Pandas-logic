# NumPy & Pandas: Data Logic & Manipulation

This repository contains my core technical notes and practical applications for data processing. It focuses on the computational "engine" of data science—managing, cleaning, and restructuring data without external visualization libraries.

##  Concept Classes

###  NumPy Foundations
* *Dimensional Array Logic:* Working with 0D to 3D arrays, understanding ndim, and using reshape to transform data structures.
* *Vectorized Operations:* Implementing mathematical functions (np.sin, np.log, np.exp) and dot products for high-performance computing.
* *Sequence Generation:* Mastering arange and linspace for precise numerical data creation.
* *Broadcasting:* Understanding the rules for performing operations on arrays of different shapes.

### Pandas Data Engineering
* *Data Consolidation:* Combining datasets using merge(), join(), and concat() to build unified DataFrames.
* *Reshaping & Pivoting:* Advanced restructuring of data using pivot and pivot_table for multi-dimensional analysis.
* *Aggregation Logic:* Using groupby() to segment data and extract statistical insights (mean, std, count).
* *Data Integrity:* Identifying and managing missing values using isnull().sum() and related cleaning techniques.
* *Statistical Profiling:* Generating comprehensive data summaries with .describe() and .transpose().
